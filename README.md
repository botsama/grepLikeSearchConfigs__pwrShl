# grepLikeSearchConfigs__pwrShl

Grep Like String search all files and their contents for a path or entire drive.

Warning: With C:\* paths you will get a permission error.  This tends to be a Windows 10 based security permission for root boot drive accessing.  Using a Subfolder or any other partition should mediate.

2019-06-10 update to normalize file path as a variable, as similar to other scripts.
